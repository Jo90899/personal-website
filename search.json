    "section": "",
    "text": "Cavo is a project I dreamed up towards the end of August 2024. As a Coptic hymnology teacher, it gets hard to teach when students haven’t learned to read Coptic and as such, are less motivated to learn the hymns. I wanted my kids to be excited to learn the beautiful Coptic hymns of the church, the way I was when my Uncle Bola taught me. However, Coptic isn’t like Spanish or French, which young kids can learn in schools: it’s a dead language, only used in the Coptic Orthodox Church today. How do I make my kids excited to learn a dead language?\n The word “ⲥⲁⲃⲟ” (Cavo), is a Coptic word meaning “to learn.” Ⲥⲁⲃⲟ is an app that anyone can use to learn Coptic in a fun and engaging way, from beginner level to high level. The kind of content on Ⲥⲁⲃⲟ will range from the alphabet and basic/simple words, to grammar and various language rules. In addition, since hymns are a large part of the Coptic church, I have plans to inlcude a “Hymnology Classroom” where users can learn more about hymns and their history."

    "section": "The Team",
    "text": "The Team\nⲤⲁⲃⲟ is important to me and is something I hope will be a benefit to the global Coptic community. So, for a strong product, I needed a strong team:\n\nSoftware and CS\nAs an engineering major, my computer science experience is limited. So I called up some of the smartest and most enthusiastic coders I know:\n\nDaniel Endraws: UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering & Computer Science graduate, Daniel is very skilled in CS and has plenty of experience with the field. I grew up with Daniel and was mentored by him many years ago in Scouts. Daniel has helped me out on many occasions, both for personal and school projects and I was excited to get him on this project with me.\nChristian Khoury: Christian is a Computer Science student at UCI who helps out with the LA Coptic Diocese websites, programs, and more. I met Christian only a couple years ago at an LA Coptic Clubs retreat and when I began this project, I knew he would be a great fit.\nJacob Soryal: Also a UCI Computer Science student, Jacob was one of the scouts I mentored until eventually he and I began leading our troop together. Jacob serves with me at our home church, St. Marina in Irvine, and also feels the need for a project like Ⲥⲁⲃⲟ.\n\n\n\nCoptic Linguistics\nWhile I can read and chant in Coptic, I still need a team to help with making lessons, checking grammar, and more…\n\nJohn Abdelmalek: John is a UCI Medical Student and my older brother. He teaches the larger classes and leads our church congregation during our services. He is a great resource for hymnology and also has a variety of connections within the Coptic community who can fill any gaps in his knowledge (although gaps are very rare).\nDavid Georgy: Very much like John, David is also a UCI Medical Student and a leader of our church congregation with many connections. David was also the first person to sing me the Happy Birthday song in Coptic, which I consider the best birthday wish I have ever received.\n\n\n\nAdvisors/Support\nⲤⲁⲃⲟ requires much more than a team to make the product. Growing a non-profit business, as well as spreading product to the global Coptic community in the long-term, is another large aspect of the project. My priest, Father Michael Fanous, has helped me get started and make connections with many people, including the CEO of the Coptic Chamber of Commerce, Nader Anise. Speaking to him helped me set up a good path for the coming months to get this project off the ground and I am truly grateful for the opportunity.\nMore updates coming soon!!"

My academic career at Harvey Mudd has led me to many useful and interesting classes in the field of Engineering. In addition to my coursework at Mudd, I am also a research student in Prof. Santana’s CuTE Lab, where I help parametrize and test a 3D bioprinter. Outside of classes, I enjoy playing club volleyball for the Claremont Colleges team and teaching Coptic hymnology classes and Sunday School at my home church in Irvine.\nFor more information about my academic coursework, work experience, hobbies, and more, check out the About Me page!

Picking up personal projects was my way of exploring this field until I made it to Harvey Mudd, where I got to use this passion in my academics and in projects for coursework and clients. Check out some of my experiences, coursework, and other cool things I’ve done!\n\nWork Experience\n\nInternships\n\nApplied Medical - Summer Intern: In the summer of 2024, I was an intern at Applied Medical. I worked on projects including chemical handling safety training, large-scale management, Design Verification/Validation, and more!\nThirdwayv Inc. - Summer Intern:\n\n\n\nOn-Campus Jobs\n\nHarvey Mudd Machine Shop Proctor: One-sentence summary of your responsibilities and the skills you developed.\nHarvey Mudd Engineering Systems TA: Brief explanation of the project and your contribution to its success.\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nCoursework\n\nDigital Design (E85, Microprocessor Systems): Brief description of the course and its relevance to your field.\nEngineering Systems (E79, E101, E102): Quick overview of what you learned and how it applies to your career goals.\nMechanical/Material Engineering (E83, E86): Highlight a key project or skill acquired from this course.\nBiomedical Engineering: Highlight a key project or skill acquired from this course.\n\n\n\nExtracurricular Activities and Acheivements\n\nEagle Scout/Adult Volunteer: List of your top technical skills with proficiency levels.\nSunday School/Hymnology Teacher: Overview of your most valuable soft skills and how you’ve applied them.\nAwards and Certifications: Highlight your most significant awards or certifications.\n\n\n\nWhat Else?\nDespite all these activities, I still have time to engage in hobbies and have some fun, usually involving physical activities or food (or both). I grew up in California playing soccer in the backyard with my brother and dad, then club and school volleyball as I started high school. As such, you will often find me playing soccer on the beach or passing a volleyball around with some friends before taking a swim in the water."

    "text": "First and foremost, entrepreneurial workshop? Yes, this semester I am taking a course on entrepreneurship taught by two VERY successful Mudd Alums, Josh Jones and Benson Tsai. For this class, students get to pick an entrepreneurial endeavor and run with it, while being guided by their professors. One of the benefits of this class is the new experiences, like this field trip.\n The CEO of Terraform Industries, Casey Handmer, invited our class to see what the inside of a growing startup looks like and gave us some really valuable experience into the kind of stuff we have been doing over the last couple months. Terraform is an environmental technology company aimed at producing cheap natural gas from sunlight and air. Within the castle walls, Terraform is working to advance the renewable energy quest with their 17 dedicated employees.\nAfter getting the tour from Casey, I remember thinking to myself how surreal even this level of startup was. From the various graphs taped to the wall to the single 3D printer humming in the background to the large empty rooms yet to be filled, I felt overwhelmed. So, I guess it was fairly comforting when a classmate asked Casey at the end of the tour, “What is one thing we can start doing right now to further our entrepreneurial endeavors?” Casey responded with a simple answer:\n“Start a blog.”\nSo, welcome to my blog…"
